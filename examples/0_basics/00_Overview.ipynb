    "# Overview of adcc\n",
    "\n",
    "ADC-connect – or adcc in short – is a Python-based framework to connect to arbitrary programs and perform calculations based on the algebraic-diagrammatic construction approach (ADC) on top of their existing self-consistent field (SCF) procedures. Four SCF codes can be used with adcc out of the box, namely [molsturm](https://molsturm.org),\n",
    "[psi4](https://psicode.org/), [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf), and [veloxchem](https://veloxchem.org/). Without expressing any particular preference these notebooks will focus on psi4 and pyscf to obtain an SCF reference, but the other codes work very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of these tutorial notebooks is to introduce adcc from the practitioners perspective and give an idea of supported features. For a more structured documentation and an API reference, see https://adc-connect.org. In particular for installation instructions see https://adc-connect.org/installation.html. If you cannot be bothered to install adcc just to try these notebooks, just go to https://try.adc-connect.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks do not put a strong emphasis on the theory and numerical methods behind adcc, with the exception of a small introduction in [02_Theory.ipynb](02_Theory.ipynb). If have the desire to dig deeper, a review of ADC literature is provided in https://adc-connect.org/theory.html."
