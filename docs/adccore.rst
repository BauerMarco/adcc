adccore: C++ core library
=========================

This page contains a reference of the *adccore* C++ library
and its classes and functions generated automatically
from the *adccore* source code.
The functions and classes discussed here are exposed to Python
as the :ref:`libadcc` python module.

Reference state
---------------
This category lists the *adccore* functionality,
which imports the data from the :cpp:class:`libadcc::HartreeFockSolution_i`
interface into the :cpp:class:`libadcc::ReferenceState`
for internal use by the library.
See :ref:`hostprograms` for details how to connect
host programs to adcc.
Important classes in the process are :cpp:class:`libadcc::MoSpaces`,
which collects information about the occupied and virtual
orbital spaces, and :cpp:class:`libadcc::MoIndexTranslation`,
which maps orbitals indices between the ordering used by adccore
and the one used by the SCF program.

Perturbation theory
-------------------
:cpp:class:`libadcc::LazyMp` lazily computes second-order and third-order
MÃ¸ller-Plesset perturbation theory on top of the reference
held by a :cpp:class:`libadcc::ReferenceState`.

AdcMatrix and matrix cores
--------------------------
:cpp:class:`libadcc::AdcMatrix` sets up a representation of the ADC
matrix for a particular method. My the means of matrix cores,
which actually do the work, this allows to perform matrix-vector products
or access the diagonal of such a matrix under a common interface.

Tensor functionality of :cpp:class:`libadcc::Tensor`
using the libtensor tensor library.
