The `adcc` project was initiated in 2016 at Heidelberg University, where most
initial development took place. The first working code version days was heavily
inspired by the [`adcman`](http://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2013.859313) package
by Michael Wormit *et. al.*. Even though the internal structure of `adcc`
has changed a lot since the early days, `adcc` in its current stage
would have probably not been possible without being able to test
and compare against the `adcman` code along the way.
