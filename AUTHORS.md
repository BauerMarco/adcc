# adcc authors

The `adcc` project was initiated by Michael F. Herbst (``info@michael-herbst.com``)
in 2016 at Heidelberg University, where most of the initial development took place.
The first working code version was heavily inspired by the
[`adcman`](http://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2013.859313) code
by Michael Wormit *et. al.*, also developed in Heidelberg.

Thus far `adcc` has become an alternative entry point to perform
ADC calculation on top of the [`libtensor`](http:/doi.org/10.1002/jcc.23377)
tensor library stack by Evgeny Epifanovsky *et. al.*.

This is an incomplete, alphabetical
list of all people who have contributed to the
present codebase of `adcc` either in the form of code,
fruitful discussions, suggestions or comments.
